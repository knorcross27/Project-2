# Project 2: Automatic Headlight Control System
## Sami Foodim and Kye Norcross
### System Behavior:
The goal for this project was to build upon the Driver's Education Car Alarm System form Project 1, and then create a headlight subsystem as well. Within the ignition subsystem, we added the ability for the ssytem to allow additional start attempts. This means that if the user attempts to inhibit the ignition when it is not enabled (i.e. when the user starts the car if either seatbelt is unbuckled or either seat is not occupied), the buzzer will sound, error message and reasons will be displayed, and then they will be given the opportunity to start the car again. Additionally, we added a function that allowed the engine to continue running even if the driver/passenger removed their seatbelts or exited the car, after initially having all conditions satisfied and starting the car. Lastly, for the ignition subsystem we made it so that when the engine was running, the engine could be stopped when the ignition button was pushed and then released.
